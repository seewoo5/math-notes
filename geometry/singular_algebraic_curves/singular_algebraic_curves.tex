This note closely follows Chapter 4 of Serre's \emph{Algebraic Groups and Class Fields}.
We generalize the theory in Chapter 2 to \emph{nonsingular} curves via normalization.
We also associate a singular curve $X_\frm$ to a modulus $\frm$ of a nonsingular curve $X$, which will be used in the construction of generalized Jacobians later.
Most of the theorems (Riemann--Roch, Serre duality) hold when we replace $\cL(D)$ and $\underline{\Omega}(D)$ with appropriate notions $\cL'(D)$ and $\underline{\Omega}'(D)$ for singular curves, and the genus $g$ with \emph{arithmetic} genus.

\section{Structure of a singular algebraic curve}

\subsection{Normalization of an algebraic variety}

For an irreducible algebraic variety $X'$, \emph{normalization} $X \to X'$ can be constructed locally as taking integral closure $\scO_Q$ of each $\scO'_Q$ in $K = k(X')$.
For an affine open $U' \subset X'$ with $A' = \scO'(U')$, the corresponding normal affine variety $U \to U'$ corresponds to an integral closure $A$ of $A'$ in $K$, and \emph{glueing} these $U$ give $X$.
Let $\scO = p_\ast(\scO_X)$, whose stalks are $\scO_Q = \cap_{P\to Q} \scO_P$ and $\scO'$ is a subsheaf of $\scO$.
See \href{https://mathoverflow.net/questions/109395/is-there-a-geometric-intuition-underlying-the-notion-of-normal-varieties}{this MO answer} for the nice geometric intuitions of normal varieties.

Here's an example from \href{https://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/725/class20.pdf}{Vakil's note}: consider a \emph{nodal curve} $X': y^2 = x^3 + x^2$, singularity at $(0,0)$.
One needs to normalize the ring $R = k[x, y] / (y^2 - x^3 - x^2)$.
The element $t = y / x \in \mathrm{Frac}(R) = k(x, y)$ satisfies the integral equation $t^2 = x + 1$, and a corresponding variety $X = \{(x, y, t): y^2 = x^3 + x^2, y = tx, t^2 = x + 1\}$ in $\bA^3$ with a projection map $X \to X', (x, y, t) \mapsto (x, y)$.
This gives a normalization of $X'$, which is a nonsingular curve (which can be checked by computing it's Jacobian
$$
J = \begin{pmatrix}
    -3x^2 - 2x & 2y & 0 \\
    -t & 1 & -x \\
    1 & 0 & -2t
\end{pmatrix}
$$
whose determinant is 0 and the first two columns are linearly independent, so has rank $2 = 3 - 1$ and nonsingular.
In fact, $X \simeq \bA^1$ since $X = \{(t^2 - 1, t(t^2 - 1), t)\}$.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{axis}
    \pgfplotsinvokeforeach{-1.1, -1.05, ..., 1.1}
    { \draw[gray] (#1*#1-1,#1*#1*#1-#1,#1) -- (#1*#1-1,#1*#1*#1-#1,0);
    }
    \addplot3[variable=t,mesh,domain=-1.2:1.2] (t^2-1,{t*(t^2 - 1)}, t);
    \addplot3[variable=t,mesh,domain=-1.2:1.2,color=black] (t^2-1,{t*(t^2 - 1)}, 0);
\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Another example is the curve with a \emph{cusp}: $X': y^2 = x^3$, singularity at $(0, 0)$.
We can normalize the ring $R = k[x, y] / (y^2 - x^3)$ similarly as $\widetilde{R} = k[x, y, t] / (y^2 - x^3, t^2 -x, y - tx)$ (taking $t = y/x$), which corresponds to the curve $X = \{(x, y, t): y^2 = x^3, t^2 = x, y = tx\} = \{(t^2, t^3, t)\}$.
It's Jacobian is given by
$$
J = \begin{pmatrix}
    -3x^2 & -2y & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & -2t \\ -t & 1 & -x
\end{pmatrix}
$$
whose determinant is 0 and the first two columns are linearly independent, so has rank $2 = 3 - 1$.
In fact, we have $X = \{(t^2, t^3, t)\} \simeq \bA^1$.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{axis}
    \pgfplotsinvokeforeach{-1.1, -1.05, ..., 1.1}
    { \draw[gray] (#1*#1,#1*#1*#1,#1) -- (#1*#1,#1*#1*#1,0);
    }
    \addplot3[variable=t,mesh,domain=-1.2:1.2] (t^2,t^3,t);
    \addplot3[variable=t,mesh,domain=-1.2:1.2,color=black] (t^2,t^3,0);
\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

We denote as $\frc$ for the annihilator of $\scO / \scO'$, call it as the \emph{conductor} of $\scO$ into $\scO'$.
It is a coherent sheaf of ideals on $X'$ and its variety $S'$ is a set of points on $X'$ which are not normal.
Put $S = p^{-1}(S')$, so that $p$ gives an isomorphism between $X \backslash S$ and $X' \backslash S'$, i.e. $p$ is a birational morphism.
For $Q \in X'$, $\frc_Q = \{f \in \scO_Q': fg \in \scO_Q' \,\forall g \in \scO_Q\}$, which is also the largest ideal of $\scO_Q'$ that is also an ideal of $\scO_Q$.
We have a chain of inclusions
$$
\scO_Q \supset k + \frr_Q \supset \scO_Q' \supset k + \frc_Q
$$
where $\frr_Q$ is the radical of $\scO_Q$, same as the set of $f \in \scO_Q$ such that $f(P) = 0$ for all $P \mapsto Q$.

\subsection{Case of an algebraic curve}

In case of curves, a curve is normal if and only if nonsingular, so normalization corresponds to \emph{desingularization} for curves.
For a normalization $p: X \to X'$, the corresponding $S' \subset X'$ and $S = p^{-1}(S') \subset X$ are finite sets, and especially, $S'$ is nothing but the set of singular points of $X'$.
For all $Q \in X'$, $\delta_Q := \dim(\scO_Q / \scO'_Q)$ is finite, and positive if and only if $Q \in S'$.
$\delta_Q$ is also an \emph{analytic invariant}: it is preserved under taking completions: $\delta_Q = \dim (\widehat{\scO_Q} / \widehat{\scO_Q'})$.
We call that two singular points are \emph{analytically isomorphic} if they have same $\delta_Q$.

We know that $\scO_Q / \scO_Q'$, $\scO_Q' / \frc_Q$, and $\scO_Q / \frc_Q$ are all finite dimensional, so $\frc_Q \supset \frr_Q^n$ for some $n > 0$ and we get 
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:rad}
    k + \frr_Q \supset \scO_Q' \supset k + \frr_Q^n.
\end{equation}

\begin{question}
For given $X'$ and $Q \in X'$, how can we compute $\delta_Q$?
\end{question}

\subsection{Construction of a singular curve from its normalization}

We can also ``denormalize'' a nonsingular curve $X$, i.e. do opposite direction of above.
More precisely, let $X$ be an irreducible nonsingular curve and $S \subset X$ be a finite set.
Let $R$ be an equivalence relation on $S$, and define $S' := S / R$.
Then Proposition 2 says that $X' := (X \backslash S) \cup S'$ with the canonical projection $p:X \to X'$ becomes an algebraic curve with singularities at $S'$.
Intuitively, we are identifying points in $S$ under the equivalence relation $R$ to get a singular curve $X'$ with singular points $S'$.

Here's a sketch of the ``construction'' of $\scO'$, the structure sheaf of $X'$.
Put $\scO_Q := \cap_{P \to Q} \scO_P$ (taking intersection) and $\frr_Q$ to be the radical of $\scO_Q$.
For each $Q \in S'$, choose $\scO_Q' \subset \scO_Q$ different from $\scO_Q$ so that \eqref{eqn:rad} is satisfied for some $n$.
For $Q \in X' \backslash S'$, define $\scO_Q' = \scO_Q$.
Then this will form a sheaf $\scO'$.

To prove that $(X, \scO_X)$ is a normalization of $(X', \scO')$, it is enough to check when $X$ is affine.
Assume that $A$ is a coordinate ring of $X$.
Let $A' = \cap_{Q \in X'} \scO_Q' \subset A$.
For each $P \in X$, let $\fra_P = \{f \in A: f(P) = 0\} \subset A$ be the maximal ideal corresponds to $P$ and $\frr = \cap_{P \in S} \fra_P$.
By \eqref{eqn:rad} there exists $n$ such that $A' \supset k + \frr^n$, and one can show that $A$ is an $A'$-module of finite type; so is integral over $A'$.
Then $A'$ is also a $k$-algebra of finite type and we have a corresponding affine variety $Y$, and $X$ becomes a normalization of $Y$ ($A$ is an integral closure of $A'$).
Now we can prove that $Y$ is actually isomorphic to $(X', \scO')$.

% (CJ, Connor): In affine case, it should work in this way: for $X = \Spec A, Y = \Spec B$ affine with common closed subscheme $Z = \Spec C$, then identifying $X$ and $Y$ along $Z$ corresponds to
% \begin{center}
%     \begin{tikzcd}
%         A \times_C B \arrow[r] \arrow[d] & B \arrow[d, twoheadrightarrow] \\
%         A \arrow[r, twoheadrightarrow] & C
%     \end{tikzcd}
% \end{center}

The above proof is constructive, i.e. it gives a coordinate ring $A'$ of a corresponding $X'$ when $X = \Spec A$ is affine.
Here's a different approach that might be easier to understand, at least for me.
Consider the case when $X = \bA^1 = \Spec k[x]$ and $S = \{1, -1\}$, so that we are identifying two points on a line to get a singular curve.
Then the resulting $X' = X / \{1 \sim -1\} = \Spec A'$ should correspond to a universal object to the following diagram
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}
        & \{1\} \arrow[d, hookrightarrow] \arrow[rdd, bend left] & \\
        \{-1\} \arrow[r, hookrightarrow] \arrow[rrd, bend right] & \bA^1 \arrow[rd, twoheadrightarrow] & \\
        & & X'
    \end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
which corresponds to the diagram of rings
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}
        & k & \\
        k & k[t] \arrow[l, "\ev_{-1}"] \arrow[u, "\ev_{1}"] & \\
        & & A' \arrow[lu, hookrightarrow] \arrow[llu, bend left] \arrow[luu, bend right]
    \end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
In other words, $A'$ is a subring $A' = \{f \in k[t]: f(-1) = f(1)\}$.
One can show that $A'$ is generated by two elements $t^2 - 1$ and $t^3 - t$, i.e. $A' = k[t^2 - 1, t^3 - t]$, and $A'$ is not integrally closed since $t = \frac{t^3 - t}{t^2 - 1}$ is in its fractional field, and integral over $A'$ ($t^2 = (t^2 - 1) + 1$), but $x \not \in A'$. We also know that $A'[t] = k[t] = A$, so $A$ is an integral closure of $A'$.
Now, one can prove that $A' \simeq k[x, y] / (y^2 - x^3 - x^2)$ via $(t^2 - 1, t^3 - t) \leftrightarrow (x, y)$.

Here's a slightly more complicated example: $X = k[s, t] / (s^2 + t^2 - 1)$ and $S = \{(0, -1), (0, 1)\}$, i.e. identifying two points on a circle.
Let $B' = \{f \in k[s, t]: f(0, -1) = f(0, 1)\}$ and $A' = B' / (s^2 + t^2 - 1)$.
One can show that $B' = k[t^2 - 1, t(t^2 - 1), s, st]$, hence
$$
A' = k[-s^2, -s^2 t, s, st] / (s^2 + t^2 - 1) = k[s, st] / (s^2 + t^2 - 1).
$$
and this is isomorphic to $k[x, y] / (y^2 - x^2 (1 - x^2))$ under the map $(s, st) \leftrightarrow (x, y)$.
This gives an equation $y^2 = x^2 (1 - x^2)$ of $X'$.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.5]
  \tkzInit[xmin=-2,xmax=2,xstep=1,ymin=-2,ymax=2,ystep=1]
  % \tkzGrid[sub]
  \tkzAxeX[step=1]
  \tkzAxeY[step=1]
  \tkzFctPar[samples=400,domain=-pi:pi]{cos(t)}{cos(t) * sin(t)}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Another examples is when we identify three distinct points.
Consider $X = \bA^1$ and $S = \{-1, 0, 1\}$.
By the above arguments, $X' = X / S = \Spec A'$ where $A' = \{f \in k[t]: f(-1) = f(0) = f(1)\}$.
One can show that
$$
A' = k[t(t^2 - 1), t^2(t^2 - 1), t^3(t^2 - 1)] \simeq k[x, y, z] / (y^2 - xz, x^4 - y(y^2 - x^2)),
$$
i.e. $X'$ is an intersection of two surfaces $y^2 = xz$ and $x^4 = y(y^2 - x^2)$ in $\bA^3$.

\subsection{Singular curve defined by a modulus}

Using the previous construction, we can define a (singular) curve $X_\frm$ from a modulus $\frm$ of $X$.
Here we assume $\deg(\frm) \ge 2$ (otherwise $X_\frm = X$).
Let $S$ be the support of $\frm$.
Take $S' = \{Q\}$ to be a single point and $X' := (X \backslash S) \cup S'$ (i.e. merge every singular points of $X$ into a single point).
Put
\begin{align*}
    \frc_Q &:= \{f \in \scO_Q : f \equiv 0\,(\mathrm{mod}\,\frm)\} \\
    \scO_Q' &:= k + \frc_Q
\end{align*}
Then we can apply the previous construction to get a singular curve $X_\frm$ with a unique singular point $Q$, where
$$
\delta_Q = \dim (\scO_Q /\scO_Q') = \dim (\scO_Q / (k + \frc_Q)) = \dim (\scO_Q / \frc_Q) - 1 = \deg(\frm) - 1.
$$
For example, when $\frm = 2P$ for some $P \in X$, the corresponding $X_\frm$ with $p:X \to X_\frm$ has an \emph{ordinary cusp} at $Q = p(P)$, i.e. analytically isomorphic to $y^2 - x^3$ at $Q$.
When $\frm = P_1 + P_2$ with $P_1 \ne P_2$, it identifies two different points on $X$, and the resulting curve $X_\frm$ is analytically isomorphic to $xy = 0$ at the singular point $Q$ (i.e. $Q$ is a \emph{node}).

\begin{question}
For a given irreducible nonsingular curve $X$ (in terms of certain set of equations) and a modulus $\frm$, how to compute $X_\frm$, i.e. how to find a corresponding equation of $X_\frm$?
Can we do this at least for $X = \bP^1$ or $\bA^1$?
\end{question}


\section{Riemann--Roch theorems}

\subsection{Notations}

Now assume $X$ (and so $X'$) are complete curves, so also projective.
Let $g$ be the genus of $X$ and put
\begin{align*}
    \delta &= \sum_{Q\in S'} \delta_Q \\
    \pi &= \delta + g.
\end{align*}
For a divisor $D$ on $X$ prime to $S$, we have a sheaf $\cL(D)$ on $X$ associated to it.
Under the birational map $X \to X'$, we can define a sheaf $\cL'(D)$ on $X'$ via
$$
\cL'(D)_Q := \begin{cases} \cL(D)_Q & Q \not \in S' \\ \scO_Q' & Q \in S'. \end{cases}
$$
Also, we define
\begin{align*}
    L'(D) = \rH^0(X', \cL'(D)), &\quad I'(D) = \rH^1(X', \cL'(D)),\\
    l'(D) = \dim L'(D), &\quad i'(D) = \dim I'(D)
\end{align*}
as in the nonsingular case.
Especially, when $X' = X_\frm$, we denote above as $L_\frm(D), I_\frm(D), l_\frm(D), i_\frm(D)$.


\subsection{The Riemann--Roch theorem (first form)}

The Riemann--Roch theorem for singular curves has a same form as nonsingular case, but just replace $l(D), i(D), g$ with $l'(D), i'(D), \pi$: for any divisor $D$ prime to $S$,
$$
    l'(D) - i'(D) = \deg(D) + 1 - \pi.
$$
We can prove it by using the same argument as in Chapter 2 for nonsingular curves: by considering a cohomology sequence, on can reduce it to the case of $D = 0$, i.e. $\chi(X', \scO') = 1 - \pi$.
Using $0 \to \scO' \to \scO \to \scO / \scO' \to 0$ and $\chi(X', \scO / \scO') = \dim \rH^0(X', \scO / \scO') = \delta$ ($\scO / \scO'$ is supported on $S'$), it reduces to prove that $\chi(X', \scO) = 1 - g$.
This follows from the fact that $\rH^q(X, \scO_X) = \rH^q(X', \scO)$ for all $q \ge 0$: this holds essentially because $X \to X'$ is a finite map.


\subsection{Application to the computation of the genus of an algebraic curve}

By considering $D = 0$, we get $\pi = i'(0) = \dim \rH^1(X', \scO')$.
As a corollary, we can compute \emph{arithmetic genus} $p_a(X')$ of a curve: recall that it is defined as
$$
p_a(X') = 1 - \chi(X') = 1 - \dim \rH^0(X', \scO') + \dim \rH^1(X', \scO')
$$
Since $X'$ is connected, $\dim \rH^0(X', \scO') = 1$ and we get
$$
p_a(X') = \pi = \delta + g.
$$
Note that $p_a(X')$ depends on the base field $k$; see also \href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0BY6}{Stacks project} (but again, we assume $k$ is algebraically closed).
This is useful since $p_a(X')$ and $\delta$ are supposed to be easy to compute, and we can use them to compute $g$.
For example, if $X'$ is a complete intersection of $r-1$ hypersurfaces of degre $a_1, \dots, a_{r-1}$ in $\bP^{r}$ we get
$$
\pi = \frac{1}{2} a_1 \cdots a_{r-1}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{r-1} a_i - r - 1 \right) + 1
$$
and when $r = 2$, we get a \emph{Pl\"ucker formula}
$$
g = \frac{1}{2} d (d - 3) + 1 - \delta.
$$

\subsection{Genus of a curve on a surface}

Let $V$ be a projective non-singular surface and $X' \subset V$ be a curve in it.
Then we have a general formula for $p_a(X')$ in terms of a certain intersection number:
$$
p_a(X') = 1 + \frac{1}{2}X'\cdot(X' + K)
$$
where $K$ is a canonical divisor of $V$, i.e. divisor of a non-zero differential form of degree 2.


\section{Differentials on a singular curve}


\subsection{Regular differentials on $X'$}

A differential $\omega$ on $X$ is said to be \emph{regular at $Q \in S'$} if $\sum_{P \to Q} \Res_P(f\omega) = 0$ for all $f \in \scO_Q'$.
We denote $\underline{\Omega}_Q'$ for the set of regular differentials, which is a $\scO_Q'$-submodule of $D_k(X)$.
If we put
$$
\underline{\Omega}_Q := \bigcup_{P \to Q} \underline{\Omega}_P,
$$
then $\underline{\Omega}_Q \subset \underline{\Omega}_Q'$ and we have a duality between $\scO_Q / \scO_Q'$ and $\underline{\Omega}_Q' / \underline{\Omega}_Q$, given by the pairing $(f, \omega) \mapsto \sum_{P \to Q} \Res(f\omega)$ above.
When $X' = X_{\frm}$ with $\frm = \sum_P n_P P$, $\omega$ is regular on $X'$ if and only if
$$
\sum_{P \in S} \Res_P(\omega) = 0 \quad\text{and}\quad v_P(\omega) \ge -n_P\,\forall P \in S.
$$
For general case, regular differentials are characterized as follows: $\omega$ is everywhere regular on $X'$ if and only if $\Tr_g(\omega) = 0$ for every rational function $g$ on $X$ which is not a $p$-th power (if $\cha (k) = p$) and which belongs to all $\scO_Q'$, $Q \in S'$.


\subsection{Duality theorem}

Serre duality also extends to singular curves.
For a divisor $D$ prime to $S$, associate a sheaf $\underline{\Omega}'(D)$ by
$$
\underline{\Omega}'(D)_Q = \begin{cases}
    \underline{\Omega}_Q' & Q \in S' \\ \underline{\Omega}(D)_Q & Q \not \in S'.
\end{cases}
$$
We also put $\Omega'(D) = \rH^0(X', \underline{\Omega}'(D))$.
Then $\omega \in \Omega'(D)$ if and only if it is regular at all $Q \in S'$ and also $v_P(\omega) \ge v_P(D)$ for all $P \not \in S$.
Then we have $\Omega'(D) \simeq I'(D)^\ast = \rH^1(X', \cL'(D))^\ast$, and we get $i'(D) = \dim \Omega'(D)$.
Especially, $i'(0) = \dim\Omega'(0) = \pi$, i.e. the dimension of everywhere regular differential forms on $X'$ is $\pi$.
Proof uses the ad\`elic language in Chapter 2.


\subsection{The equality $n_Q = 2 \delta_Q$}

For $Q \in S'$, we can identify the conductor ideal $\frc_Q$ with a divisor $\sum_{P \to Q} n_P P$ such that $\frc_Q = \{f \in \scO_Q: (f) \ge \sum_{P \to Q} n_P P\}$.
By using the duality between $\scO_Q / \scO_Q'$ and $\underline{\Omega}_Q' / \underline{\Omega}_Q$, one can see that they have the same annihilators and $f \in \frc_Q$ iff $v_P(f \omega) \ge 0$ for all $P \to Q$ and $\omega \in \underline{\Omega}_Q'$.
In other words, $n_P = \sup_{\omega \in \underline{\Omega}_Q'} (- v_P(\omega))$.
Now put $n_Q := \sum_{P \to Q} n_P$ be the degree of the divisor $\frc_Q$.
Then we have an inequality between $n_Q$ and $\delta_Q$:
$$
\delta_Q + 1 \le n_Q \le 2 \delta_Q
$$
for all $Q \in S'$, and $n_Q = 2 \delta_Q$ if and only if $\underline{\Omega}_Q'$ is a free $\scO_Q'$-module of rank 1.
When this holds for all $Q \in S'$, $\underline{\Omega}'$ is locally free and corresponds to a class of divisors of $K'$ on $X'$, where $K = K' - \frc$.
Taking $\deg$ gives $\deg(K') = 2\pi - 2$, and $\underline{\Omega}'(D) \simeq \cL'(K' - D)$, which gives a definitive form of the Riemann--Roch theorem
$$
l'(D) - l'(K' - D) = \deg(D) + 1 - \pi.
$$

For the previous examples of $\frm = P_1 + P_2$ or $\frm = 2P$, the theorem shows that $\delta_Q = 1$ for $Q \in X_\frm$, since $n_Q = 2$ and $1 = \frac{n_Q}{2} \le \delta_Q \le n_Q - 1 = 1$ for both cases.

\subsection{Complements}

Note that $n_Q = 2 \delta_Q$ holds when
\begin{itemize}
    \item $X'$ is a complete intersection in a projective space,
    \item $X'$ is embedded in a nonsingular surface $V$.
\end{itemize}
% In other words, if $n_Q$ is odd, then $X' = X_\frm$ is neither be a complete intersection nor embedded in a nonsingular surface.
