\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The goal of this note is to introduce the arithmetic of function fields, which is the analogue of number theory for polynomials.
Especially, our main goal is to study various evidences of the following claim:

\begin{myquote}
A theorem for integers is true for polynomials (over finite fields), and often easier to prove.
\end{myquote}
For example, we will see a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem for polynomials, which only requires few pages to prove.

Dictionary between the integers and the polynomials over finite fields can be found in Table \ref{tab:dictionary} of Appendix.


\subsection*{Exercises}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Prove that $\bZ$ is not a polynomial ring over a field. In other words, show that there is no field $k$ such that $\bZ \cong k[T]$ as rings.
    \item Think about your favorite theorems in number theory, and try to find their polynomial analogues. Some of them may appear in this note, but some of them may not.
\end{enumerate}
