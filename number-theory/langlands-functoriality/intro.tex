\section{Introduction}

\begin{conjecture}[Langlands functoriality conjecture] Let $G$ and $G'$ be reductive groups over a global field $F$. 
\end{conjecture}
This is an introductory note on Langlands functoriality conjecture view towards classical examples. Here is a list of topics we are going to study:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Automorphic induction
    \item Base change
    \item Rankin-Selberg product
    \item Symmetric power lifting and Selberg's 1/4 conjecture
    \item Jacquet-Langlands correspondence
    \item Theta correspondence and Howe duality
\end{enumerate}
