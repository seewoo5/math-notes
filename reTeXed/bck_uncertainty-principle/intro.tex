\section*{Introduction}


The inequalities of Heisenberg's experiments, with the notations of the present article, have the form
\[
    \int x^2 |f(x)|^2 \dd x \int y^2 |\what{f}(y)|^2 \dd y \geq 1 / 16 \pi^2
\]
(if $f$ is of norm $1$)s, and they are optimal, since equality holds for $f(x) = e^{-\pi x^2}$.
In the following form
\[
    \Delta p \Delta x \geq \hbar
\]
they are interpreted by physicists as a relationship between ???;
