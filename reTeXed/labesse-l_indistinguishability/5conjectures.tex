\section{Conjectures}
\label{sec:conjectures}

We do not give here the expression for the ``stable'' term of the trace formula.
Let us simply say it is very close to the complete trace formula for $G(\bA)$.
I am led to formulate the following conjectures:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
    \item A representation $U \in \widehat{S(\bA)}$ occurs in $\rho^g$ for some $g \in G(\bA)$, if and only if $U$ occurs in the restriction ot $S(\bA)$ of some representation $\widetilde{U}$ of $G(\bA)$ occuring in the space of cusp forms for $G(\bA)$ relative to some character of the centre.
    \item The multiplicity one theorem is true for the representation of $S(\bA)G(F)$ on $L^2_0(S(\bA) G(F) / G(F)) = L^2_0(S(\bA) / S(F))$.
    \item If $U \in \widehat{S(\bA)}$ is unstable $m(U) = 1$ if and only if $m_\varepsilon(U) \ge 1$ for all $\varepsilon \in \mathscr{E}$ and $m(U) = 0$ otherwise.
\end{enumerate}
