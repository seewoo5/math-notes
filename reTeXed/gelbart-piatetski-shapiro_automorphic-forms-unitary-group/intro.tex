\section*{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Our purpose is to define and analyze $L$-functions attached to automorphic
cusp forms on the unitary group $G = \rU_{2, 1}$ and a six-dimensional representation
\[
    \rho: {}^L G \to \GL_6(\bC)
\]
of its $L$-group.

The motivation for this work is three fold.


Firstly, we use these L-functions to analyze the lifting of cusp forms
from $\rU_{1, 1}$ to $\rU_{2, 1}$; here the model for our work is Waldspurger's $L$-function theoretic characterization of the image of Shimura's map for modular forms of half-integral weight (cf. [Wald]).

A second motivation comes from the need to relate the poles of the $L$-functions for $G$, to integrals of cusp forms over cycles coming from $\rU_{1, 1}$.
The prototvpe here is the recent proof of Tate's conjecture for Hilbert modular surfaces due to Harder, Langlands, and Rapaport.

Thirdly, we view this work as a special contribution to the general program of constructing local $L$ and $\varepsilon$ factors of Langlands type for representations of arbitrary reductive groups.
In [PS1], such a program was sketched generalizing classical methods of Heeke, Rankin--Selberg, and Shimura.
Related developments are discussed in [Jacquet], [Novod], [PS2], and [PS3].
For the unitary group $\rU_{2, 1}$ the present paper extends the developments initiated in [PS3].
