\section{$L$-functions \`a la Rankin--Selberg--Jacquet}
\label{sec:3}


We are now ready to attach (global) $L$-functions to (non-degenerate) cuspidal representations $\pi$ of $G(\bA)$, The method used goes back to [Rankin] and [Selberg] who used it to analytically continue the convolution of Dirichlet series corresponding to classical holomorphic modular forms.
The reformulation of their construction in the language of representation theory was carried out in detail by [Jacquet], for $\GL_2 \times \GL_2$, and by [PS 1] in general (but without details or exp1icit computation).
In this Section (and the next), we carry out the construction for $G = \rU_{2, 1}$.

\label{sec:3.1}


Recall $V$ is a 3-dimensional vector space over $E/F$ and $(-,-)_V$ is a hermitian form on $V$ whose matrix with respect to the basis $\{\ell_{-1}, \ell_{0}, \ell_{1}\}$ is $\left[\begin{smallmatrix}
    0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1& 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 0
\end{smallmatrix}\right]$.
