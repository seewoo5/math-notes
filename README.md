### ReTeX-ed articles

I re-TeXed some of the existing articles with old typesets for my own study. Let me know if there are any issues.

* I. Piatetski-Shapiro, *Work of Waldspurger*, Lie group representations, II (College Park, Md., 1982/1983), 280â€“302. Lecture Notes in Math., 1041 Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1984
